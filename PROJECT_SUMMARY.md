# StaticCMS - Project Summary

StaticCMS is a lightweight, powerful Content Management System that combines a **FastAPI** backend with a **React** (Vite) admin dashboard to generate fully responsive, high-performance static websites.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Block-Based Editor
- Create pages using modular blocks: **Hero sections**, **Text content**, and **Image Sliders**.
- Support for multiple sliders on the same page with unique initialization to prevent JavaScript conflicts.

### 2. Advanced Navigation (Header)
- **Dynamic Logo**: Support for custom image uploads or text-based branding.
- **Nested Menus**: Recursive sub-menu management (dropdowns) with pure CSS/Glassmorphism.
- **Configurable CTA**: A customizable "Call to Action" button in the header (manageable text, link, and color).
- **Glassmorphism Design**: Premium "Liquid Glass" header with background blur and translucency.
- **Responsive Navigation**: Mobile-first hamburger menu for smaller screens.

### 3. Static Site Generation (SSG)
- Instant generation of HTML/CSS/JS files from the database.
- Optimized for performance and SEO with metadata management.
- Integration of **Lucide Icons** and **Swiper.js** for modern UI/UX.

### 4. Media & API
- Integrated image upload system.
- Standardized API on port `8000` with correctly configured CORS for local development.
